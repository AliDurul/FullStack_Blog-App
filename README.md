<p>
The goal was to construct a blog post management system using Node.js and Express for the backend, with MongoDB serving as the database. JWT tokens were utilized to enhance security during user authentication processes, including registration and login functionalities. On the frontend, powered by React, the Material-UI library was seamlessly integrated to ensure a visually engaging and user-friendly design. React-Router played a pivotal role in enabling smooth page transitions, while the strategic use of Formik and Yup libraries streamlined form structuring and validation processes. The integration of React-Toastify further enriched user interactions by providing informative notifications. This project highlighted my proficiency in a comprehensive tech stack, encompassing Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Material-UI, JWT tokens, React-Router, Formik, and Yup, contributing to the successful development of an efficient and secure blog post management system.</p>
